1. We are trying to model a valid game of Battleship from start to finish. This boardgame involves two players with ships they place on a 10x10 grid that is unknown to their opponent. Players then take turns picking a coordinate on their opponent's board to attack (which they have not attacked before), and the opponent must state whether this was a hit (on one of their ships) or a miss (on open water). We want to model a valid sequence of such guesses that, assuming the ship placement is given, random, and wellformed at the start of our model, results in one of the players winning by sinking all of their opponent's ships with some of their own still unsink. A ship is sunk when all the coordinates it occupies have been attacked.

2. One thing we chose not to model was ship placement, we just assume that at the start of our trace that the ships have been placed validly by each player. This is because the process of ship placement does not have any specific rules besides the fact that it must be done and valid by both players before turns of attacking begin. In the real boardgame, player's have a secondary grid that they place red and white pegs on to track where on their opponent's grid they've attacked and the result of these moves (red for a hit, white for a miss). We also did not model this because it is a tool to help human players play the game well, but is not technically part of the game (in the sense that a player tracking this can do things that aren't wellformed and the game can still proceed and be played in a valid way) nor necessary to play. The checks we have are ... The run statements we have are ... Sterling will produce a ... and you can interpret this by ...
